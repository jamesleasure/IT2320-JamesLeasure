        //      next element to .highlight

        window.onload = function () {

            Step 2. Change color of font for Paragraphs when the user clicks on one of the following buttons.
            Note that it would be a better approach to create a single function to change the font color
            for all paragraph elements and then call it with a parameter.  You would need to setup
            another function to call between window.onload and the changeColor function.<br />
            <button type="button" id="changeRed" value="Red" />
            <button type="button" id="changeGreen" value="Green" />
            <button type="button" id="changeBlue" value="Blue" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Step 3. Change color background color for h2 elements when the user clicks on one of the folowing buttons.<br />
            <button type="button" id="changeHeadingRed" value="Red" />
            <button type="button" id="changeHeadingGreen" value="Green" />
            <xxbuttonx type="button" id="changeHeadingBlue" value="Blue" />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            Why a re-introduction? Because JavaScript is notorious for being the world's most misunderstood programming language. It is often derided as being a toy, but beneath its layer of deceptive simplicity, powerful language features await. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's useful to start with an overview of the language's history. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language — despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a European standards organization, which resulted in the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.
        </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is an object-oriented dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — so many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. One of the key differences is that JavaScript does not have classes; instead, the class functionality is accomplished by object prototypes (see more about ES2015 Classes).The other main difference is that functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around like any other object.
